That was too big project to put lines of codes here. Futhermore there are copyrights from PhD. But I think I can write some summary from this.

What I've learn from credit scoring was different aim of modelling. In previous cases I'd predict some kind of values or future score. In this project I was forced to estimate the risk associated with decision of granting a loan. The accuracy of model was ability to predict if clients would pay off loan or not.

However, there were more purposes for outcome. First was bank profit maximization but there were also important points like maximization of installment loan quantity which is bank marketing policy. So the final outcome was something between max profit and quantity of loans to bring more clients.
